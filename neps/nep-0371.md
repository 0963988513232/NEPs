## Summary

There is currently no way to query for information about access keys stored on your contract at runtime.

## Motivation

As contracts start to use access keys in more creative ways, developers will want to know information such as the access key's allowance, nonce, receiver and more. Since contracts are often built for scalability, Gas and storage costs are often delegated to the end user. If you charge the user for an access key and its allowance, when the key is deleted or used up, that allowance should be refunded to the purchaser. Currently, there is no way to query for the leftover allowance before a key is deleted. This information can tell you how much Gas was spent, and allows for a slew of different scenarios to arise.

## Rationale and alternatives

Without creating a promise, we can only query for information stored on the same shard. This is why in this proposal, the access key information at runtime will only come from keys stored on the current contract. We had also investigated the possibility of introducing pagination for all keys stored on the contract but this is infeasible at the moment due to the significant redesign requirement of the VM logic.

## Specification

In the runtime, key information will be queryable by passing in the desired public key. The key information will be of the following form.

```js
enum KeyPermission {
    FullAccess,
    FunctionCall(FunctionCall),
}

type KeyInformation = {
    public_key: string,
    access_key: {
        nonce: number,
        permission: KeyPermission
    }
}

type FunctionCall = {
    receiver_id: string,
    allowance: string,
    method_names: Array<string>,
}
```

The key information will expose the public key and access key data. If the key is a full access key, the permission will simply be a string `"FullAccess"`. If the key is a function call access key, the permission will be of type `FunctionCall`.

This information should be queryable via a new function called `key_info_by_public_key_for_current_account` which takes a public key as a parameter.

```ts
function key_info_by_public_key_for_current_account(
  public_key: &PublicKey,
): KeyInformation | null
```

This function should be exposed in the environment and callable using `env::key_info_by_public_key_for_current_account();`. An example of this can be seen below.

```rs
pub fn check_key_exists(&self, pk: PublicKey) {
    let key_info: KeyInformation = env::key_info_by_public_key_for_current_account(&pk);

    if let Some(info) = key_info {
        near_sdk::log!("key info found");
    } else {
        near_sdk::log!("No public key found");
    }
}
```

An example of returning the allowance of the key can be seen below.

```rs
pub fn check_key_allowance(&self, pk: PublicKey) {
    let key_info: KeyInformation = env::key_info_by_public_key_for_current_account(&pk).unwrap();

    if let KeyPermission::FunctionCall(fc) = key_info.access_key.permission {
        let allowance = fc.allowance;
        near_sdk::log!("key allowance: {}", allowance);
    } else {
        near_sdk::log!("key has no allowance as it's a full access key");
    }
}
```

## Future possibilities

Some of the future possibilities for the standard could be to return a vector of `KeyInformation` by paginating through the keys on the contract. In addition, we could add a `key_total_supply` function that returns the number of access keys stored on the contract. One could also expand and introduce the ability to query for access key info from other contracts by using a promise.
