## Summary

An extension to FT standard that allows users to give allowance to other accounts or keys for transfering [NEP-141] tokens on behalf of them. 

## Motivation
People familiar with [NEP-141] might have seen the prior art [NEP-21] which talks about a similar approach to Ethereum [ERC-20] standard, where a third party account is given an allowance to withdraw on behalf of an account. The discussion on NEP-21 proposal was specifically for `ft_transfer_call`, where the proposal was weighed against `async` paradigm and was rejected. 

The current motivation is to delegate to a third party the ability to withdraw funds and allow them to do that fast.

A valid use-case for using such a flow is when an application needs to have transaction finality in one block. Given the sharded design of NEAR Protocol, `ft_transfer` calls, unless `sender_is_receiver`, would take at least 2 blocks to generate execution outcomes for all of it's receipts except for the refund. However, if an account gives approval of withdrawal of [NEP-141] tokens to the FT contract account or a key that belongs to the FT contract account, since `sender_is_receiver`, the `ft_transfer_from` transaction finality would be achieved in one block. This opens up the opportunity to have low-latency transactions on [NEP-141] contracts.

Another use-case is a subscription model. A balancer owner can approve a certain allowance for the spender to withdraw funds on a hourly/monthly/yearly basis. In this case, after initial allowance, balance owner doesn't need to intitate transfers and can take a passive role while the spender could withdraw funds on the allowance. The balance owner can always `cancel` their subscription by removing the allowance. 


## Rationale and alternatives
Currently there is no way of allowing a third party to withdraw funds based on an allowance. `ft_transfer` transactions have to be initiated by the balance owner. This limits certain use-cases like the one above.


 

#### Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

This design follows a similar pattern to [ERC-20] approval/allowance pattern that has been widely accepted in the industry and battle-tested. Shortcomings of the pattern is well-known and necessary changes to overcome the shortcomings is explained in this design. (See `ft_approve` function for atomicity)


#### What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?

[Not sure what to put here]

#### What is the impact of not doing this?

Not providing a standard on third-party allowances for transfers could lead to different implementations on smart-contracts that could lead to security vulnerabilities. 


## Specification

### Guide-level explanation

We should be able to do the following:
- Approve a spender to withdraw funds on behalf of the balance owner account
- Allow spender to either be an Account or an Access Key
- Allow spender to withdraw funds
- Allow an account to get their approvals

There are a few concepts in the scenario above that needs explaining.

- **Spender**: An account or a access key that has approval to withdraw funds from another account
-  **Balance owner account**: An account that is the subject of the withdrawal. 
-  **Allowance**: The amount of tokens for the spender account that the spender can use on behalf of the balance account owner.
-  **Approval**: A mapping of Account Owner and Spender to allowance.


## Reference Implementation

**NOTES**

- All amounts, balances and allowance are limited by U128 (max value 2**128 - 1).
- Having `0` as amount is not permitted, unlike ERC20 specification.
- There is a need to explicity mention `ft_transfer_from_account` and `ft_transfer_from_key` due to an edge case where giving a function call access key to call `ft_transfer_from` would allow this access key to use any of the funds approved for the contract account id itself. Thus, `ft_transfer_from` is divided into two different functions.

```rs
    // ---- Approval standard -----

    /// Enum that is used to identify the Spender
    pub enum AccountOrKey {
        Account(AccountId),
        Key(PublicKey),
    }



    /// Approve the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of
    /// `env::predecessor_account_id`.
    ///
    /// Arguments:
    /// * `spender` The address which will spend the funds.
    /// * `current_value` The amount of tokens currently allowed. This is used to ensure atomicity.
    /// * `value` The amount of tokens to be spent.
    pub fn ft_approve(&mut self, spender: AccountOrKey, current_value: U128, value: U128)

    /// Transfer funds from a `from` to `to` specifically for `account` as spender
    /// * `to` The address which the transfer will be made from
    /// * `from` The address which the transfer will be made to
    /// * `amount' The amount of tokens to be transferred
    /// * `memo` Optional message to be sent with the transfer
    pub fn ft_transfer_from_account(
        &mut self,
        from: AccountId,
        to: AccountId,
        amount: U128,
        memo: Option<String>,
    )
     /// Transfer funds from a `from` to `to` specifically for `key` as spender
    /// * `from` The address which the transfer will be made from
    /// * `to` The address which the transfer will be made to
    /// * `amount' The amount of tokens to be transferred
    /// * `memo` Optional message to be sent with the transfer
    pub fn ft_transfer_from_key(
        &mut self,
        from: AccountId,
        to: AccountId,
        amount: U128,
        memo: Option<String>,
    )
    /// Transfer funds from a `from` to `to` adddress for accounts. This method is specifically for cross-contract calls and returns a promise
    /// * `from' The address which the transfer will be made from
    /// * `to` The address which the transfer will be made to
    /// * `amount' The amount of tokens to be transferred
    /// * `memo` Optional message to be sent with the transfer
    /// * 'msg' message to be sent to the receiving contract
    pub fn ft_transfer_call_from_account(
        &mut self,
        from: AccountId,
        to: AccountId,
        amount: U128,
        memo: Option<String>,
        msg: String,
    ) -> PromiseOrValue<U128>
    /// Transfer funds from a `from` to `to` adddress for keys. This method is specifically for cross-contract calls and returns a promise
    /// * `from' The address which the transfer will be made from
    /// * `to` The address which the transfer will be made to
    /// * `amount' The amount of tokens to be transferred
    /// * `memo` Optional message to be sent with the transfer
    /// * 'msg' message to be sent to the receiving contract
    pub fn ft_transfer_call_from_key(
        &mut self,
        from: AccountId,
        to: AccountId,
        amount: U128,
        memo: Option<String>,
        msg: String,
    ) -> PromiseOrValue<U128>
    
    /// Callback function for ft_transfer_call_from, handles the remaining allowance. Increases the current allowance by the unused amount. 
    pub fn ft_resolve_transfer_from(
        &mut self,
        spender: AccountOrKey,
        sender_id: AccountId,
        receiver_id: AccountId,
        amount: U128,
    ) -> U128

    /****************/
    /* VIEW METHODS */
    /****************/

    /// Returns the allowance amount for a spender
    /// * 'owner' Owner of the allowance
    /// * 'spender' Spender of the allowance can be a key or an account
    pub fn ft_allowance(&self, owner: AccountId, spender: AccountOrKey) -> 
    /****************/
    /*     EVENTS   */
    /****************/
    
    ///Emitted when the allowance of a spender for an owner is set by a call to approve. value is the new allowance.
    Approval(owner: AccountId, spender: AccountId, value: U128)
    
```


## Security Implications

The possibility of giving unlimited allowance to an account or a key would allow malicious key holder or account owner to drain the whole account. 



## Drawbacks 

Even though this is an extension to [NEP-141], it complicates the working model of the async nature of NEAR. People might compare this model with [ERC-20] allowance model and the way it is being used.

The implementation should clearly state that this is not a replacement of [NEP-141] but an extension for a different use-case.




## Future possibilities

- Adding deposit on key allowance
- Deleting unused Allowance to avoid state bloat
