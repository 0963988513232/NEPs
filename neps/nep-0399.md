## Summary

Currently, the state of blockchain is stored in our storage in the format of persistent merkelized tries. 
Although the trie structure is needed to compute state roots and prove the validity of states, it is expensive 
to read from the trie structure because a traversal from the trie root to the leaf that contains the key
value pair could require 2 * key_length of disk access in the worst case. 

In addition, we charge receipts by the number of trie nodes they touched (TTN cost), 
which is confusing to developers and unpredictable. This NEp proposes the idea of FlatStorage,
which stores a flattened key/value pairs of the current state on disk. This way, any storage read requires at most
2 disk reads. As a result, we can make storage reads faster, decrease the fees, and get rid of the TTN
cost.

## Motivation

The motivation of this project is to increase performance of storage reads and remove TTN cost.

## Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?

- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
  
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Specification

FlatStorage will store key value pairs from trie keys to the value refs (the rocksdb key of where the value of the trie item is stored) on disk. Let’s call this block the head of flat storage. To look up a trie value from flat storage, we will need at most 2 disk reads, once to get the value reference, once to get the value. 

Since there could be forks, flat storage must also support lookups for other blocks. 
To achieve that, we also store block deltas in memory, and use the deltas to compute state 
at other blocks. We call these deltas FlatStorageDelta (FSD). Let’s say the flat storage head 
is at block h, and we are applying transactions based on block h’. Then we need some FSDs to 
access the state at h’ from the snapshot at h. All these FSDs must be able to fit in 
memory, otherwise, each state key lookup will trigger more than 2 disk reads and we will 
have to set storage key read fee higher. 

However, the consensus algorithm doesn’t provide any guarantees in the distance of blocks 
that we need to process since it could be arbitrarily long for a block to be finalized. 
To solve this problem, we make another proposal (TODO: attach link for the proposal) to 
set gas limit to zero for blocks with height larger than the latest final block’s height + X. 
This way, flat storage only needs to store FSDs for blocks with height less than the latest 
final block’s height + X. And since there can be at most one valid blocks per height, 
FlatStorage only needs to store at most X FSDs in memory. 

### FSD size estimation
To set the value of X, we need to see how many block deltas can fit in memory.

We can estimate FSD size using protocol fees. 
Assume that flat state stores a mapping from keys to value refs. 
Maximal key length is ~2 KiB which is the limit of contract data key size. 
During wasm execution, we pay `wasm_storage_write_base` = 64 Ggas per call and 
`wasm_storage_write_key_byte` = 70 Mgas per key byte. 
In the extreme case it means that we pay `(64_000 / 2 KiB + 70) Mgas ~= 102 Mgas` per byte. 
Then the total size of keys changed in a block is at most 
`block_gas_limit / gas_per_byte * num_shards = (1300 Tgas / 102 Mgas) * 4 ~= 50 MiB`.

To estimate the sizes of value refs, there will be at most 
`block_gas_limit / wasm_storage_write_base * num_shards
= 1300 Tgas / 64 Ggas * 4 = 80K` changed entries in a block. 
Since one value ref takes 40 bytes, limit of total size of changed value refs in a block 
is then 3.2 MiB. 

To sum it up, we will have < 54 MiB for one block, and ~1.1 GiB for 20 blocks.

Note that if we store a value instead of value ref, size of FSDs can potentially be much larger.
Because value limit is 4 MiB, we can’t apply previous argument about base cost.
Since `wasm_storage_write_value_byte` = 31 Mgas, one FSD size can be estimated as 
`(1300 Tgas / storage_write_value_byte cost * num_shards)`, or ~170 MiB,
which is 3 times higher.

// TODO: From the above calculation, if we store 

### Storage Writes

## Reference Implementation 
The following are the important structs that will be implemented in flat storage. 

`FlatState`: It provides an interface to get value or value references from flat storage. It 
             will be part of `Trie`, and all trie reads will be directed to the FlatState object. 
             A `FlatState` object is based on a block `block_hash`, and it provides key value lookups
             on the state after the block `block_hash` is applied.

`ShardFlatStates`: It provides an interface to construct `FlatState` for each shard.

`FlatStorageState`: It stores some information about the state of the flat storage itself,
                    for example, all block deltas that are stored in flat storage and the flat 
                    storage head. `FlatState` can access `FlatStorageState` to get the list of 
                    deltas it needs to apply on top of state of current flat head in order to 
                    compute state of a target block.

`FlatStateDelta`: a HashMap that contains state changes introduced in a block. They can be applied
on top the state at flat head to compute state at another block.

It may be noted that in this implementation, a separate `FlatState` and `FlatStorageState` 
will be created for each shard. The reason is that there are two modes of block processing, 
normal block processing and block catchups. 
Since they are performed on different range of blocks, flat storage need to be able to support
different range of blocks on different shards. Therefore, we separate the flat storage objects
used for different shards.

### DB columns
`DBCol::FlatState` stores a mapping from trie keys to the value corresponding to the trie keys,
based on the state of the block at flat storage head.
- *Rows*: trie key (`Vec<u8>`)
- *Column type*: `ValueOrValueRef`

`DBCol::FlatStateDeltas` stores a mapping from `(shard_id, block_hash)` to the `FlatStateDelta` that stores
state changes introduced in the given shard of the given block.
- *Rows*: `{ shard_id, block_hash }`
- *Column type*: `FlatStateDelta`

`DBCol::FlatStateHead` stores the flat head at different shards. 
- *Rows*: `shard_id`
- *Column type*: `CryptoHash`

### ```FlatState```
```FlatState``` will be created for a shard `shard_id` and a block `block_hash`, and it can perform 
key value lookup for the state of shard `shard_id` after block `block_hash` is applied.
```rust
pub struct FlatState {
/// Used to access flat state stored at the head of flat storage.
store: Store,
/// The block for which key-value pairs of its state will be retrieved. The flat state
/// will reflect the state AFTER the block is applied.
block_hash: CryptoHash,
/// In-memory cache for the key value pairs stored on disk.
#[allow(unused)]
cache: FlatStateCache,
/// Stores the state of the flat storage
#[allow(unused)]
flat_storage_state: FlatStorageState,
}
```

```FlatState``` will provide the following interface.
```rust
/// get_ref returns the value or value reference corresponding to the given `key` 
/// for the state that this `FlatState` object represents, i.e., the state that after 
/// block `self.block_hash` is applied.
pub fn get_ref(
    &self,
    key: &[u8],
) -> Result<Option<ValueOrValueRef>, StorageError>
```

###```ShardFlatStates```
`ShardFlatStates` will be stored as part of `ShardTries`. Similar to how `ShardTries` is used to 
construct new `Trie` objects given a state root and a shard id, `ShardFlatStates` is used to construct
a new `FlatState` object given a block hash and a shard id. 

```rust
pub fn new_flat_state_for_shard(
    &self,
    shard_id: ShardId,
    block_hash: Option<CryptoHash>,
) -> FlatState
```

###```FlatStorageState```
`FlatStorageState` is created per shard. It provides information to which blocks the flat storage 
on the given shard currently supports and what block deltas need to be applied on top the stored
flat state on disk to get the state of the target block. 

```rust
fn get_deltas_between_blocks(
    &self,
    target_block_hash: &CryptoHash,
) -> Result<Vec<Arc<FlatStateDelta>>, FlatStorageError>
```

```rust
fn update_flat_head(&self, new_head: &CryptoHash) -> Result<(), FlatStorageError>
```

```rust
fn add_delta(
    &self,
    block_hash: &CryptoHash,
    delta: FlatStateDelta,
) -> Result<StoreUpdate, FlatStorageError>
```

#### Thread Safety
We should note that the implementation of `FlatStorageState` must be thread safe because it can 
be concurrently accessed by multiple threads. A node can process multiple blocks at the same time
if they are on different forks. Therefore, `FlatStorageState` will be guarded by a `RwLock` so its
access can be shared safely.

```rust
pub struct FlatStorageState(Arc<RwLock<FlatStorageStateInner>>);
```

### Migration Plan

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the NEP process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this NEP that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this NEP?

## Future possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project in your proposal.
Also consider how the this all fits into the roadmap for the project
and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
NEP you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future NEP. Such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent NEPs.
The section merely provides additional information.
