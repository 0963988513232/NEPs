## Summary

Delegate keys allow to assign permissions to another account instead of a key. 
This allows to delegate ownership of an account by giving set of permissions that are usually restricted only to FullAccessKey.

## Motivation

Issue that became evident trying to develop upgradability patterns for contracts is complexity of going from full access key on the contract to a contract managed by multisig or a DAO.

Right now it is required to implement a complex logic of upgrading contract and managing assets/control inside the contract in the first version to allow “owner” account to call these methods.

## Rationale and alternatives

## Specification

See updates to AccessKey.md and Actions.md

## Reference Implementation

TBD

## Drawbacks

This adds complexity to the account model.
