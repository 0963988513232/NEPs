## Introduction

The Rainbow Bridge is represented by a family of smart contracts that implement light clients and arbitrary trustless actors who wish to forward necessary data between Near and Ethereum blockchains.

The API allows developers to:

- pass arbitrary data between smart contracts on different chains
- make arbitrary calls between smart contracts on different chains

The Rainbow Bridge vision (not available today) includes several other projects:

- a fully collateralized NEAR stable token available on the Ethereum network
- a fully collateralized ETH stable token available on the NEAR network
- smart contract based Ethereum proxy-accounts for NEAR users
- smart contract based NEAR proxy-accounts for Ethereum users

*The Rainbow Bridge can support any other blockchain for which these components are developed.*

### Use Cases

Please refer to the diagram above where (A), (B) and (C) appear to the left and (1), (2) and (3) appear the right.

#### Use Case A-B-C-B-A 

*NEAR smart contract must verify an event was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain*

- A contract running on the *NEAR blockchain* requires verifiable proof that an event has been recorded on the *Ethereum blockchain*.  
- The contract `(A)` invokes a method on the `EthEventVerifier` `(B)`, passing in the appropriate parameters to represent the event
- `EthEventVerifier` `(B)` unpacks the Ethereum event and extracts the related block header which it passes on to the `EthClient` `(C)`
- `EthClient` `(C)` returns a boolean indicating whether the block header was indeed recorded on the Ethereum blockchain
- `EthEventVerifier` `(B)` passes this result on to the contract `(A)` as proof or rejection of the event as valid

#### Use Case 1-2-3-2-1

*Ethereum smart contract must verify a transaction result was recorded on the NEAR blockchain*

- A contract running on the *Ethereum blockchain* requires verifiable proof that a transaction result has been recorded on the *NEAR blockchain*.  
- The contract `(1)` invokes a method on the `NearTxResultVerifier` `(2)`, passing in the appropriate parameters to represent the transaction result
- `NearTxResultVerifier` `(2)` unpacks the Near transaction result and extracts the related block header which it passes on to the `NearClient` `(3)`
- `NearClient` `(3)` returns a boolean indicating whether the block header was indeed recorded on the NEAR blockchain
- `NearTxResultVerifier` `(2)` passes this result on to the contract `(1)` as proof or rejection of the transaction result as valid

*In both cases, the light clients `EthClient` and `NearClient` are supported by arbitrary trustless actors (`EthRelay` and `NearRelay`) who wish to forward necessary data between Near and Ethereum blockchains, respectively.*


### Software

**Core Components**

Two smart contracts, `(C)` and `(3)` establish the baseline source of truth for blockchain activity on the "other" network.

- (C) `NearClient`- *smart contract hosted on **Ethereum** network*  \
   This contract is a NEAR light client that receives NEAR block headers.  It verifies and stores block hashes only.

- (3) `EthClient` â€“ *smart contract hosted on the **NEAR** network*  \
   This contract is an Ethereum light client that receives Ethereum block headers.  It verifies ethash and longest chain rule and stores block hashes only.

**Reference Implementations**

Two smart contracts demonstrate what is possible using the Rainbow Bridge.  These contract are intended to be used as **reference material** for developing other contracts about various blockchain platforms. 

*A note about NEAR and Ethereum blockchains*

- At its core, NEAR is a sharded transaction processing engine which records *transaction results*.  These *transaction results* are a verifiable source of truth about the NEAR blockchain.
- At its core, Ethereum is single threaded computer which, at various points in time, records *events*.  These *events* are a verifiable source of truth about the Ethereum blockchain.

- `NearTxResultVerifier` - *smart contract on **Ethereum** network*   \
  This contract performs verification of **NEAR transaction results** that have been included into NEAR blocks. It uses Merkle trees and hash preimages for verification.

- `EthEventVerifier` - *smart contract on **NEAR** network*   \
  This contract performs verification of **Ethereum events** that have been included into Ethereum blocks. It uses Merkle trees and hash preimages for verification.

**Supporting Scripts**

- `NearRelay` - an arbitrary, trustless actor that forwards NEAR block headers to the `NearClient` smart contract which is hosted on the Ethereum network.
- `EthRelay` - an arbitrary, trustless actor that forwards Ethereum block headers to the `EthClient` smart contract which is hosted on the NEAR network.


## Setting up the Rainbow Bridge

1. clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:nearprotocol/near-bridge.git`
2. run `NearRelay` node script to do two things:
   - deploy `NearClient` contract (written in Solidity) to Ethereum network (note: just use ABI file to connect if the `NearClient` contract is already deployed)
   - start sending NEAR block headers to `NearClient` every 10 seconds
3. build and deploy `EthClient` contract (written in Rust and compiled to Wasm) to NEAR network
4. run `EthRelay` script to start sending Ethereum block headers to `EthClient` as often as they're available, at least once every 10 seconds

Now both networks have knowledge of one another

- Ethereum Network is queried by `EthRelay` at ~10s intervals for latest block headers.  `EthRelay` then sends this to `EthClient`, a contract deployed on the NEAR network
- NEAR network is queried by `NearRelay` at ~10s intervals for latest block headers.  `NearRelay` then sends this to `NearClient`, a contract deployed on the Ethereum network

As part of our development of the Rainbow Bridge framework, we have chosen something about each network (Ethereum and NEAR) which is as close to "ground truth" as possible. By this we mean some fact or detail about the network which establishes a baseline from which we can build up.  

For Ethereum we've selected **cryptographic proofs of events** on the Ethereum network.  This is called `EthEventVerifier`, a contract deployed on the NEAR network which can verifiably prove that an event occurred on the Ethereum network.  You could say this contract is available for use by any other contracts running on the **NEAR network** as an *Ethereum Event Oracle*.

For NEAR we've selected **cryptographic proofs of transaction execution results** on the NEAR network.  This is called `NearTxResultVerifier`, a contract deployed on the Ethereum network which can verifiably prove that a transaction was executed on the NEAR network.  You could say this contract is available for use by any other contracts running on the **Ethereum network** as a *Near Transaction Result Oracle*.

Once deployed, `EthEventVerifier` and `NearTxResultVerifier` are available for use by smart contracts operating in their respective environments.
